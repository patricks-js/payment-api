  <b>Simple solution for <a href="https://github.com/PicPay/picpay-desafio-backend">this challenger</a> using Bun.</b>
</p>

<h2 id="started">üöÄ Getting started</h2>

The goal of this project is implement a simplified version of a payment service. It should be possible to make transfers between ordinary customers and merchants, and the **merchant only receive transfers**. Ordinary users can make and receive transfers from any other customer.

### Installation

You need to have this two main global dependencies installed:

- Bun Latest (or NVM, but ensure that bun is installed as a node global dependency)
- Docker/Docker Engine with Docker Compose (both latest)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patricks-js/simplified-payment-api.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies running `bun install`

3. Up containers with `docker-compose up`

4. (Optional) For contributing, run `bun run prepare` to sync git hooks

### Usage

1. Start the application running `bun start # or start:dev for development mode`
2. The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3333

### Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
bun run test
```

To run tests with **watch mode**, run the following command

```bash
bun run test:dev
```
